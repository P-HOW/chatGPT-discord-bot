The ChatGPT Discord Bot is a Python-based project that lets you build your own Discord bot powered by ChatGPT, Gemini, or Bing image generation. It supports both direct desktop execution and Docker deployment. The bot provides various modes such as public, private, and reply-all, and comes with features like persona switching, system prompts, and image generation integration.

Setup requires creating a Discord bot, adding its token to an .env file, installing dependencies, and optionally configuring an OpenAI API key or Bing/Google Gemini cookies for image generation. Users can interact with the bot via slash commands (/chat, /draw, /switchpersona, etc.) and customize logging, prompts, and modes as needed.
